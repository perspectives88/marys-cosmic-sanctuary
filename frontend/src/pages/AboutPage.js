              <p>
                My path to becoming a healing guide and storyteller wasn't linear‚Äîand that's exactly why it's powerful. 
                Through my own experiences with life transitions, identity exploration, and the deep work of healing, 
                I've learned that our most challenging moments often become our greatest teachers.

                Whether it's navigating burnout, processing trauma, or simply feeling like you're in a season of 
                profound change, I've been there. I've felt the isolation that can come with deep transformation, 
                and I've discovered the healing that happens when we share our stories with others who truly understand.
